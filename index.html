probably will update this in the future, meanwhile, please pray for myself in this full-of-exams times, just working on being a better programmer :) <br> oh i'm a programmer<br> right now i do have a job but if you want to offer me a 5 figures job i might think about it, just google me up, you'll probably find more information than in this webpage <br> thanks for visiting <br> (yes this is actually one line also i'm not using html nor body tags, sorry internet)
