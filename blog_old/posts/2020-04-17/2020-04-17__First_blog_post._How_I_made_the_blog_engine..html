                    I had a blog before, and it broke down without backups. I always searched for small blog engines, or micro PHP frameworks to handle HTTP requests and have a proper routing structure. The path I was following was always guided by the -don't know why- necessity of using an API design pattern. Well, I do know why. It's because we are in 2020 and it is an excellent standard to have around application development.<br><br> With all this being said, I was never confident with the solution I've found. Either I didn't like the theme of the engine, or didn't have the enthusiasm to change it, modifying front end components gets me bored really quick. It also always felt too much infrastructure to perform the intended task which is to upload to the internet, nothing more than plain text and a couple of images. A couple of times per month.<br> In addition, I was noticing that my work patterns were getting "professional" in a forced way -executivey, if you will-.<br><br> And from all that...this blog has raised. This blog engine, if it can be called that way, is file-based and a baby, as it was born yesterday. Briefly, the lifespan of a blog entry begins on an HTML template file -with the style making it's appearence in between style tags in the head of the HTML-, with 3 placeholders, one for the title of the post, the second one for the date of the post, and the third one for the post contents. This placeholders get replaced by a script ran to create a post with the intended data. The modified HTML file is placed in the "bin/" directory -spoiler: there isn't an "src/" directory-. And because everything is resided in a git directory, and because why not, a new commit is created with the title of the post entry, then pushed to the server, which triggers a post-receive hook that checks out the files into the production web directory. The wholesome index.php iterates the files of the "bin/" directory, displaying them as a list of links -that point to the physical html file- inside a div with a fixed height and an overflow: scroll; style property. <br> The glorious script that is ran to create the blog post is written in BASH, and performs the following operations in sequence:<br> 
                    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    ->Pulls commits from the production server<br> ->Stablishes the date of the post<br> ->Creates a directory for the post<br> ->Base html template is copied to post's directory<br> ->An 'assets/' directory is created in the post's directory<br> ->Post title is prompted<br> ->Vim opens a temporary buffer<br> ->Breaklines get replaced with HTML break lines<br> ->Base html placeholders are replaced -title from prompt, date from system, contents from temporary buffer)<br> ->Confirmation is asked in a do;while; as follows<br> While deploy = "N"<br> ->Prompt the user to view the file -open the html with an internet browser-<br> ->Prompt the user to edit the file<br> ->Prompt the user to deploy<br> Done<br> ->All files present in "assets/"'s directory of the post are copied to "bin/assets/"<br> ->A new commit is created<br> ->Commit is pushed
                    </div>
                    <br><br>Ain't much, but it's honest work.<br><br><center><img src="assets/honest.gif"/></center><br><br>I plan to improve the engine a bit. Check if directories/files exists before operating with them -or hiding the error message lol-, creating the deletion functionality, amongst with edition, of the "compiled" post entries. Sort the code. Give it a name and feed it's first beer. What I like the most of this are two things: the first is that I'm having fun and not giving myself the opportunity to judge my code. And the second is that everything is done in the command line. Check it out: <br><center><img src="assets/terminalftw.png" height="486px" width="720px"></center><br><br>I am even using the "center" html tag. Having a blast here. Is lime/green too much for the eye strain? Didn't think of that. Not going to change it.
